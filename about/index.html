                </header>


<p>Glow Stick Crisp Packet is an amorphous collective of individuals who occasionally team up to create interactive installations and do fun experiments with light.</p>

<h3>Beginnings</h3>

<p>It all began as a side effect of one spontaneous moment of 'leave no trace' in action. At the end of the night Michelle collected up a huge number of discarded glow sticks from the floor of the club. She needed something to carry them around in, so someone handed her an empty packet of crisps. You know the large foil-lined kind of packet?
</p>
<p>Looking into the packet at the infinite volume and variety of coloured light could entertain, amaze, and inspire...
</p>
<p>And, that naturally lead to the question - wouldn't it be great if you could get inside it?
</p>
<p>So plans start forming to build a bigger glow stick crisp packet... big enough to get inside, for the whole crisp experience. Over the course of several events we turned up with space blankets and glow sticks to create bigger and bigger spaces in which to explore the combination of lights and reflections.
</p>

<h3>Early Development</h3>

<p>The unexpected combination of glow stick and crisp packet, and the visual effect it created, inspired us to start replicating it on a larger scale, from which the interactive elements evolved, we started sharing it with others and learning how it could inspire others to create and collaborate too.
</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>

<p>We want to bring the Glow Stick Crisp Packet to more people at festivals and continue to innovate and inspire. We're also thinking outside of this as we look to bring a bit of festival fun into businesses, and other events, and also run our own creative discovery events, concious parties, and parent and kids events.
</p>
<p>Take away crisps - a Glow Stick Crisp Packet in a Crisp Packet kit for home experimentation.

<p>Temple of the Glow Stick Crisp Packet - the next evolution of the crisp packet experience - our strongest story line to date combined with a 3D, fully immersive world of coloured light.
