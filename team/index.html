<p>Glow Stick Crisp Packet is a co-creation, and many people have been involved over the various iterations of the idea.
</p><p>From it's beginnings at the festival where the first discovery was made, through various evenings of creation and experimentation (Crisp Packet HQ meetings), our collaborators at events such as Rumpus, Fabulus of Unicorns, Decompression, with Nest TV and Laser Porn, through to participants who have got involved at events and festivals, and like minded individuals who have found us through our installations and performances.
