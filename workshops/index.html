<p>Creativity workshops from the team behind the Glow Stick Crisp Packet experiences.</p>

<h3>Kaleidoscope Workshop</h3>
<p>Join us as we explore 200 years of Kaleidoscopes. Learn the fascinating story of Sir David Brewster's discovery and explore kaleidoscopes through the ages. Get hands on experimenting with different mirror systems, and kaleidoscope designs.
<p>Through several kaleidoscope experiments participants can learn about the physics behind the workings of different kaleidoscope designs, as well as explore geometry, or just get creative and produce beautiful designs.</p>
<p>With the addition of a projector, and elements of our <a href="http://www.glowstickcrisppacket.com/experiment/microscopadelica">Microscopaedlica</a> installation participants get to explore minature kaleidoscopic patterns under the microscope.</p>

<h3>Crisp Packet Labs</h3>

<p>A guided tour of our most popular experiments, as participants get to play with lights, lasers, toys in a creative environment in which anyone can unleash their creative side and get artistic. It doesn't require any specific artistic skills, just an open mind and playful attitude.</p>
<p>We demonstrate some of our favourite combinations of mirrors, prisms and lights, and then guide participants as they find their own favourite arrangements and combinations.</p>
