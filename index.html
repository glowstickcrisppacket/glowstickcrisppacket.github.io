									<h2>What is the Glow&nbsp;Stick Crisp&nbsp;Packet?</h2>
								</header>

<p>Glow Stick Crisp Packet is an amorphous collective of individuals who occasionally team up to create interactive installations and do fun experiments with light.</p>
<p>The Glow Stick Crisp Packet uses lights, lasers, toys and play to create an environment in which anyone can unleash their creative side and get artistic. It doesn't require any specific artistic skills, just an open mind and playful attitude. Glow Stick Crisp Packet is accessible to all, and many people who claimed they are not artists have found a creative outlet via the Glow Stick Crisp Packet.</p>
<p>Now our mission is to bring the Glow Stick Crisp Packet to more people, to encourage and spread creativity, and encourage creative collaboration.</p>
