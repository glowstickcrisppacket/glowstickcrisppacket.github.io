<h3>Ingredients: </h3>

<p>Foil space blankets, glow sticks

</p>

<h3>Process: </h3>

<p>This was the first attempt to make a glow stick crisp packet big enough to climb inside... Dave created a tunnel from the foil space blankets (can't remember exact construction method, maybe Dave can complete this?) It was filled it with glow sticks. This was a family event so it was enjoyed by kids of all ages. Some of the younger kids helped assemble interesting things out of the glow sticks. Later in the night it exploded and provided a shiny glow stick dance floor.
