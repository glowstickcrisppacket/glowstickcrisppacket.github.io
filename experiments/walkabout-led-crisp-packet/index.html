<h3>Ingredients: </h3>

<p>strong large umbrella, foil space blankets, addressable LED pixels, colour sensor, custom Arduino based controller

</p>

<h3>Process: </h3>

<p>An (unofficial) walk about performance at Boomtown and Shambala festivals during the summer of 2014.

</p>
<p>
Line the umbrella with foil blankets, attach LEDs. Once you've done this it make it very hard to close the umbrella! A colour sensor and custom electronics was added to the handle of the umbrella. This allowed the user to select colours from the environment to send rotating around the inside of the umbrella.

</p>
<p>
Passers by were given diffraction glasses and the umbrella held over their heads or rotated in front of their faces.
