<h3>Ingredients: </h3>

<p>LED coat hangers (from Nest), foil space blankets, diffraction glasses

</p>

<h3>Process: </h3>


<p>

Convert the corner of the room at the New Empowering Church into large crisp packet at an event hosted by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FabulusOfUnicornsUnicon">Fabulus of Unicorns</a>

</p>
<p>
Michael handled most of the construction as I left the custom power cable at home and had to make a last minute trip across London to collect it. The LED coat hangers that I made for Nest were reused with a couple of new programs added. The crisp packet found a secondary use as a photo studio through the night.
