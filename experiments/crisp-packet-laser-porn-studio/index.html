<h3>Ingredients: </h3>

<p>glow stick crisp packet dome, railway arch, laser porn, Nest TV, lots of people, burning man decompression party

</p>

<h3>Process: </h3>

<p>

Crisp Packet installations have appeared in many shapes and sizes. From small experimental areas, to taking over a whole room at the London's Burning Man Decompression party - our biggest installation to date.

</p>
<p>
A collaboration with Laser Porn and the Nest TV studio, the Glow Stick Crisp Packet room was a huge success. The main crisp packet was built inside a 13ft Geodesic Dome, as well as converting the whole room (a railway arch) into a giant crisp packet.

</p>
<p>
The Glow Stick Crisp Packet "experience" was born here, as elements of immersive performance were introduced. This is something that we hope to develop in future installations as we build the story line it adds a new depth to the installation.

</p>
<p>
Later in the night the crisp packet room hosts great music, and performances of contact ball juggling, LED hooping, close up magic and more, all executed in a unique way thanks to the participatory nature of the crisp packet experience.
