<h3>Ingredients: </h3>

<p>
IP68 rated waterproof LED batons, FadeCandy LED control, EEG brain wave reader

</p>

<h3>Process: </h3>

<p>
Designs are complete for the next phase of development of the LED dome which combines a daring extension to our immersive art installation, with our strongest participatory storyline to date.
</p>
<p>
The Temple of the Glow Stick Crisp Packet is a 6.5 metre geodesic dome structure that is completely covered with LEDs to form a 3D, fully immersive world of coloured light. The entrance to the dome (training area) is used to prepare participants for entry into this world.
</p>
<p>
The story line is immersive and participants are guided through the experience, but each participant can affect the environment through various methods for sensory input, including voice control, EEG brain wave control, and tactile surfaces. Sound and lighting effects are controlled by the participants. This means each interaction is different and encourages creativity from participants. There is a short debriefing and we want all participants leave the experience feeling inspired to create and better about themselves and their place in the world.
