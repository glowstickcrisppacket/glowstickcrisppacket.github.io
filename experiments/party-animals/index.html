<h3>Ingredients: </h3>

<p>
Gerred's magic wall of picture frames. Daz and Adam's face replacement software. Short-throw projector and Resolume VJ software.

</p>

<h3>Process: </h3>

<p>
An interactive wall of picture frames replaces the face of anyone who approaches with a random animal face. Created for and installed at <a href="http://rumpusparty.co.uk/">Rumpus vol 23</a>.

</p>
<p>
Custom software built using openFrameworks uses ofxCv for facetracking to add animal masks to faces, and optical flow to distort masks based on detected face movements.
