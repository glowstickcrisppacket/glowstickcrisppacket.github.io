<h3>Ingredients: </h3>

<p>glow in the dark paint, large sheet of foam board, UV laser

</p>

<h3>Process: </h3>


<p>
  For the first version I covered a large sheet of foam board (I think A2 size) with several coats of glow in the dark paint. This is the kind of paint that when you expose to sunlight then glows green when put into the dark. The way this paint works is that it contains a phosphor (i.e. a substance that radiates visible light after being energized). In this paint there is an additive (phosphor) called "strontium aluminate" that is energised by UV light.

<p>
A UV laser is used to draw onto the canvas. Designs glow brightly and then slowly fade away.

</p>
<p>
Nice effects can be created by shining the laser through diffraction glasses, prisms, or reflecting off other surfaces.

</p>
<p>
Other versions have been created since, on clothing, pillow cases, and many other surfaces. It's become a core component of the Glow Stick Crisp Packet kit.
